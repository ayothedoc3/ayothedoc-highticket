# AI-Native Agency: 30-Day Outbound Playbook

## Positioning
You are not selling "automation services." You are selling a fixed outcome:
- Lead intake -> onboarding -> delivery -> reporting system
- Implemented in a 10-day Ops Sprint
- Backed by a 40-hour time-savings guarantee

## ICP and Offer
- ICP: US marketing and web/dev agencies with 5-40 employees and clear delivery operations.
- Core pain: slow lead response, inconsistent onboarding, manual reporting, and delivery bottlenecks.
- Offer ladder:
  - Roadmap: $499
  - Ops Sprint: $7,500+
  - Care Plan: $1,500+/mo

## Metrics to Capture in Discovery
- Average lead response time
- Booked-call rate
- Time from payment to kickoff
- Hours per week spent on manual reporting
- Missed follow-up count

## Scripts
### Cold email #1 (problem first)
Subject: quick idea for {{agency_name}} ops

{{first_name}},

I looked at {{agency_name}} and noticed you are likely handling lead follow-up, onboarding, and client reporting across multiple tools.

We install an end-to-end ops system for agencies (lead intake -> onboarding -> delivery -> reporting) in a fixed 10-day sprint.

Typical wins:
- lead response in under 60 seconds
- fewer missed follow-ups
- 40+ hours/month recovered

If useful, I can send a 1-page teardown for your current workflow.

- {{your_name}}

### Follow-up #1
Subject: re: {{agency_name}} ops

Wanted to bump this.

If your team is dealing with manual follow-ups or reporting drag, I can send a concrete workflow map specific to your stack.

Worth sending?

### Follow-up #2 (Loom)
Subject: made this for {{agency_name}}

Recorded a 90-second teardown for your lead-to-booked workflow:
{{loom_link}}

If this is close to your current process, we can implement this in a 10-day sprint.

### Follow-up #3 (close/loss)
Subject: close this out?

Should I close this for now?

If timing is wrong, no issue.
If relevant, the fastest start is Roadmap ($499) and we convert it into a Sprint plan.

### LinkedIn DM opener
Noticed your team is growing. Most agencies at your stage are still handling lead follow-up and reporting manually across tools.

We install a fixed-scope ops system in 10 days. If useful, I can send a short teardown based on your current stack.
