  "sections": {
    "intro": "<p>Recurring reporting cycles slow SaaS teams when KPIs live in product databases, Stripe, CRMs, and success tools. By orchestrating n8n automations, you can surface accurate metrics for leadership while analysts focus on interpretationnot extraction.</p><p>This framework outlines how growth-stage SaaS companies should use n8n to consolidate ARR, retention, and activation dashboards on a daily cadence.</p>",
    "benefits": "<ul><li>Centralize ARR, churn, and cohort analytics without engineering queue time</li><li>Trigger alerts when north-star metrics drift outside tolerance bands</li><li>Share ready-to-present dashboards with investors and department leads</li><li>Govern data quality with automated validation rules and audit logs</li></ul>",
    "workflow": "<p>n8n pulls raw data from product databases, billing providers, and CRM endpoints, transforms it with reusable nodes, and publishes results to your BI stack or Google Sheets for real-time access.</p>",
    "steps": "<ol><li>Inventory every metric owner and the systems where raw data currently lives</li><li>Secure API access for product analytics, billing, CRM, and support platforms</li><li>Design reusable n8n sub-workflows to fetch, normalize, and join datasets</li><li>Write validation checks that flag anomalies before data hits downstream dashboards</li><li>Schedule exports to Looker, Power BI, or Notion hubs with stakeholder alerts</li></ol>",
    "results": "<p>Most SaaS operators cut manual reporting time by 60% and deliver metrics to executives by 9am daily. Automated anomaly detection also reduces embarrassing investor updates caused by broken spreadsheets.</p><p>Because n8n workflows are modular, teams can extend the system to forecast renewals, monitor product adoption, and trigger lifecycle campaigns automatically.</p>",
    "faq": "<h4>Can n8n handle warehouse-scale data?</h4><p>Yes, n8n supports pagination, batching, and native integrations with BigQuery, Snowflake, and Postgres.</p><h4>How do we keep credentials secure?</h4><p>Store secrets in n8n's credential manager with role-based permissions and enable audit logging.</p><h4>What if stakeholders need custom slices?</h4><p>Expose curated datasets via Google Sheets or push them into Metabase/Looker where teams can self-serve.</p>"
